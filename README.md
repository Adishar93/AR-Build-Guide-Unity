Augmented Reality implementation for the 
AR Application aimed at helping with manual assembly
of products / machinery by projecting a virtual model on a flat surface
(like table or floor) with step by step assembly animations.

This repository has code for Augmented Reality implementation
of the AR Application (Smart India Hackathon).
The implementation is done using Unity and Vuforia SDK.
